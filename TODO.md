# List of things to do for the editor that I can think of.

- Add cursor
- Actually add editing through keybinds
- Allow for moving between lines
- Get the font height and use it for getting the line height
- Expand upon the current renderer to allow for more customizable text rendering
- Add file manager of some sorts to naviagate files on disk
- Abstract some sort of floating window object that can hold text similar to neovim
- Add a basic capability for minor configuration through external files (e.g. setting keybinds)
- Add better motions and deletion capability
- Add auto indenting?
- Add auto brackets?
- Add syntax highlighting
- Allow for multiple buffers to be open simultaneously
- Add smarter indentation or something for c/c++ specifically.
- Add scripting language for customizing some things? (Probably not tbh, this would take a long time)
