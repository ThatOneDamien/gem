# List of things to do for the editor that I can think of.

## High Priority
- Add file manager of some sorts to naviagate files on disk
- Make editor nodal
- Add command line like vim
- Add selection capability
- Add mouse support
- Add copy/paste
- Add filetype detection

## Medium Priority
- Add a cache for the piece tree
- Add undo/redo
- Add auto indenting?
- Add auto brackets?
- Add vim-like motions (requires also adding modal editing, which I plan on doing anyway)
- Treesitter syntax highlighting?
- Abstract some sort of floating window object that can hold text similar to neovim

## Low Priority
- Expand upon the current renderer to allow for more customizable text rendering and other texture rendering
- Add a basic capability for minor configuration through external files (e.g. setting keybinds)
- Add syntax highlighting
- Allow for multiple buffers to be open simultaneously
- Add smarter indentation or something for c/c++ specifically.
- Add scripting language for customizing some things? (Probably not tbh, this would take a long time)
